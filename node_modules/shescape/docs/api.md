# Shescape API

This document provides a description of the full Application Programming
Interface (API) of Shescape.

Please [open an issue] if you found a mistake or if you have a suggestion for
how to improve the documentation.

## `escape(arg[, options])`

The `escape` function escapes a single argument and optionally takes an
[options] object. `escape` always returns a string, the escaped argument.

Non-string arguments are converted to strings; an error is thrown if this is not
possible.

## `escapeAll(args[, options])`

The `escapeAll` function escapes an array of arguments and optionally takes an
[options] object. `escapeAll` always returns an array of strings (same length as
the input array), the escaped arguments.

Non-array inputs are converted to single-value arrays. Non-string arguments are
converted to strings; an error is thrown if this is not possible.

## `quote(arg[, options])`

The `quote` function escapes and quotes a single argument and optionally takes
an [options] object. `quote` always returns a string, the escaped and quoted
argument.

Non-string arguments are converted to strings; an error is thrown if this is not
possible.

## `quoteAll(args[, options])`

The `quoteAll` function escapes and quotes an array of arguments and optionally
takes an [options] object. `quoteAll` always returns an array of strings (same
length as the input array), the escaped and quoted arguments.

Non-array inputs are converted to single-value arrays. Non-string arguments are
converted to strings; an error is thrown if this is not possible.

## Options

### `flagProtection`

Whether or not to protect against flag/option injection - e.g. an attacker
enabling `--verbose` mode to leak system information. Note that this may not
work for your use case since flags/options are specific to the implementation of
the program you invoke.

It is recommended to set this to `true` unless you use (and verified the program
you invoke supports) the special `--` option. Also, if the program you invoke
has a non-standard flag implementation you should disable this option and add
program-specific protection of your own.

|         | Escaping  | Quoting   |
| ------- | --------- | --------- |
| Used    | Yes       | Yes       |
| Default | `false`   | `false`   |
| Type    | `boolean` | `boolean` |

### `interpolation`

Whether or not to escape for usage where shell interpolation functionality is
enabled. If enabled, more characters will be escaped than usual.

It is recommended to set this to `true` if you're unsure whether or not shell
interpolation is enabled.

|         | Escaping  | Quoting |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Used    | Yes       | No      |
| Default | `false`   | n/a     |
| Type    | `boolean` | n/a     |

### `shell`

Which shell to escape for. This should **always** have the same value as the
[`node:child_process`] `shell` option. If omitted (or falsy) the system's
default shell will be used.

|         | Escaping              | Quoting               |
| ------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Used    | Yes                   | Yes                   |
| Default | `undefined`           | `undefined`           |
| Type    | `string` or `boolean` | `string` or `boolean` |
